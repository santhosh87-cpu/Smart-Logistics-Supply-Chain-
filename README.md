# Smart-Logistics-Supply-Chain-
This dataset captures logistics and supply chain operations, including asset tracking, shipment status, environmental conditions, customer transactions, and delay reasons. Below is a detailed description of each column:

1. Problem Statement
Logistics and supply chain management face several challenges, including:

Frequent shipment delays due to external and operational factors.
Inefficient asset utilization leading to increased costs.
Demand forecasting inaccuracies affecting supply chain planning.
Impact of environmental factors (traffic, temperature, humidity) on logistics.
By analyzing this dataset, we aim to predict logistics delays, optimize asset usage, and improve demand forecasting accuracy.

2. Project Objective
ðŸ”¹ Primary Goals:
âœ… Identify key factors causing logistics delays.
âœ… Build a predictive model to classify shipments as delayed or on-time.
âœ… Analyze asset utilization and suggest improvements.
âœ… Improve demand forecasting using historical data.
âœ… Provide actionable insights for supply chain optimization.

ðŸ”¹ Target Variable:
Logistics_Delay (1 = Delayed, 0 = On-time)
3. Data Science Workflow
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing
Load and inspect the dataset.
Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
Convert timestamps to a structured date-time format.
Encode categorical variables (Shipment_Status, Traffic_Status, Delay_Reason).
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze shipment status distribution.
Identify trends in delays across different factors (traffic, weather, waiting time).
Correlation analysis between asset utilization, demand forecast, and delays.
Visualization using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Feature Engineering
Create new features (e.g., delay impact scores, traffic congestion levels).
Convert latitude and longitude into meaningful regions (clustering/geospatial analysis).
Feature scaling (normalization/standardization).
ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Machine Learning Model for Delay Prediction
Supervised Learning Approach:
Classification Model (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict delayed vs. on-time shipments.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC Curve.
ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Demand Forecasting Model
Apply Time Series Analysis (ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet) to predict future logistics demand based on past trends.
ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Optimization Recommendations
Insights on minimizing delays (traffic-based rerouting, better scheduling).
Identifying underutilized assets for resource allocation.
Forecasting demand to avoid stock shortages or excess.
